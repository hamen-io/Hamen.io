      <p>Python is a general-purpose high-level programming language. It was first released in December of 1989, by Guido van Rossum. Since then, its continuous development and advancements have put it at many companies' top choice of a programming language.</p>
<p>As previously mentioned, Python is used by many high-level tech companies such as Google, Meta, and more. It is general-purposed and extremely versatile, meaning it is used from anything ranging from data analytics, to software engineering, to even machine learning and advanced mathematics.</p>

  <h2>Comparison of Python against other Languages</h2>
  <div class="content">
    <div class="border"></div>
    <div class="body">
      <p>Though Python is very popular, not only amongst beginners, but also intermediate programmers, it is actually an extremely slow language. This can be mostly attributed to the fact that it is interpreted as opposed to compiled, which, without explaining the details, basically means that it is usually inefficient when compared to languages like C#, Rust, or other compiled languages.</p>
<p>In addition to comparing, many languages use braces to define scope. For example, to create a for-loop in JavaScript, you would do:</p>
<div class="ui:code-block"><div class="header"><span style="color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.7)">javascript</span></div><div class="body"><pre>for (let i = 0; i < 100; i++) {
    console.log(i);
}</pre></div></div>
<p>Whereas Python uses ":" and indentation to denote it:</p>
<div class="ui:code-block"><div class="header"><span style="color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.7)">python</span></div><div class="body"><pre>for i in range(0, 100):
    print(i)</pre></div></div>
<p>Also keep in mind Python's "simpler" and higher-level&mdash;<i>when referring to English-like-syntax; not memory-management</i>&mdash;syntax as opposed to JavaScript.</p>
